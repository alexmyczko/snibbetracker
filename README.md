introduction
----------------
snibbetracker is a fakebit tracker written in C using SDL2 that I began working on in 2014 to learn DSP programming.
As I do not have time to work on it anymore, I decided to release the source so that someone could take over if they wanted.

config
----------------
buffer setting:

Use lower values to decrease latency, higher values
to avoid stuttering if the buffering cannot keep up.
Needs to be a power of two, for example:
256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192.

"buffer_size":4096

Path to working directory, needs to be full.
OSX example: /Users/d/Documents/snibbetracker
Windows example C:\\snibbetracker
Make sure that the folder exists before using it and that is is 
accessible by the program.

controls overview
----------------

- Axx - (left amplitud, right amplitud) can be used for amplitude, pan and turning off a tone.
- Bxx - downsample sweep down (linear, sweep) Works best on noise channel. Choose either linear or sweep.
- Cxx - downsample sweep up (linear, sweep) Works best on noise channel. Choose either linear or sweep.

- edit cursor disconnected from player cursor. (can be toggled with modifier+F)

    when loading files, just type the name without the .json and press enter, same as for saving.

build 6 - 2015-03-13 15.26
- hopefully prevented crashes when saving (directory browsing is disabled for now).
- clear track nodes before loading new project.
- fixed memory leak when using more than 16 rows.

build 5
- test release.
